# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Built a Streamlit web app to predict whether a breast tumor is Malignant or Benign using Logistic Regression trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Users enter diagnostic measurements (e.g., radius, perimeter, area), and the app displays the prediction with probability.
